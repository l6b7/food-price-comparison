## Description / Motivation
Console application that lets you track food prices
with basic operations and functionality

I decided to create this application as
food prices these days are getting ridiculous

so I wanted to find how different shops compare.

## Challanges and Decisions

Limitations of a console application was certainly the biggest challange
I am happy that I have a table creator that I can reuse or rewrite easily
I am very unhappy with user experience as you have to rely on inputting
commands to the console

I am unhappy with how I decided to make this about food products
I think this can be used for most products
but I decided to make it simple in so it could be used
as a playing ground for more advanced program
