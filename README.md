## Description / Motivation

Console application that lets you track food prices
with basic operations and functionality
I decided to create this application as
food prices these days are getting ridiculous
so I wanted to find how different shops compare.

## Decisions

Limitations of a console application was certainly the biggest challange
I am happy that I have a table creator that I can reuse or rewrite easily
In any future simple console application projects
